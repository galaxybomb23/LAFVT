# AutoUP - Automatic Unit Proof Writer

Automatic Unit Proof Writer

---

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Docker** ≥ 28.0  
- **Python** ≥ 3.10 (3.12 recommended)  
- **OpenAI API Key** set as an environment variable:
  ```bash
  export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
  ```

### Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/username/AutoUP.git
cd AutoUP

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🧠 Usage

To display all available options:
```bash
python src/run.py --help
```

### Command Syntax
```bash
python src/run.py
{harness,function-stubs,coverage,debugger,all}
--target_function_name <function_name>
--root_dir <project_root>
--harness_path <harness_dir>
--target_file_path <target_source>
--log_file <log_file_name>
--metrics_file <metrics_file_name>
```

### Modes
| Mode | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `harness` | Generates harness and Makefile. |
| `function-stubs` | Generates stubs for undefined functions that return function pointers. |
| `coverage` | Executes coverage debugger to fix coverage gaps. |
| `debugger` | Executes proof erro debugger to generate preconditions fixing CBMC errors. |
| `all` | Runs `harness`, `function-stubs`, `coverage`, and `debugger` sequentially. |
| `review` | Runs the violation reviewer workflow, which is seperate from all other workflows. See notes below.

---

## 📘 Example
```bash
python src/run.py
<mode>
--target_function_name <function-to-generate-harness-for>
--root_dir </path/to/to/project/containing/target/function> 
--harness_path </path/to/the/harness/directory>
--target_file_path </path/to/the/source/file/containing/target/function>  
```

For example, here is the command to generate an initial proof harness and makefile for the _receive function in RIOT project.

```bash
python3 src/run.py
harness
--target_function_name _receive
--root_dir /home/pamusuo/research/cbmc-research/RIOT
--harness_path /home/pamusuo/research/cbmc-research/RIOT/cbmc/harness_gen_tests_3/_receive
--target_file_path  /home/pamusuo/research/cbmc-research/RIOT/sys/net/gnrc/transport_layer/tcp/gnrc_tcp_eventloop.c
--log_file logfile.txt
--metrics_file metrics.jsonl > output-coverage-receive.txt 2>&1
```

To automatically fix coverage gaps or generate preconditions fixing errors, replace `harness` with `coverage` or `debugger` respectively.
To run all the agents sequentially, use the `all` mode.

# Violation Reviewer Mode

This is a seperate workflow that uses the AutoUP framework to assess preconditions that have been marked as VIOLATED_BUGGY by the PreconditionValidator module, which indicates a bug can potentially be triggered if the precondition is violated. To run this workflow, all of the standard input args are still needed, although only `root_dir` and `harness_path` are actually used:

```bash
python src/run.py review
--target_function_name <Not used>
--root_dir <project_root>
--harness_path <harnesses_dir>
--target_file_path <Not used>
--log_file <log_file_name>
--metrics_file <Bugged, don't use>
```

Note for this mode, `harness_path` has a different usage than before. It should now point to a directory containing multiple harness subdirs, each containing a harness and a `validation_result.json` file.

Ex.
```bash
python3 src/run.py review
--target_function_name None
--root_dir /home/tlelievr/RIOT
--harness_path /home/tlelievr/RIOT/exp-0103
--target_file_path  None
--log_file logfile.txt
```

This workflow will generate a report called violation_assessments.json, which contains an analysis and severity assessment of every VIOLATED_BUGGY precondition reported.
